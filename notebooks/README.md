The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Ben for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Wind_comparisons_jan2016.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-ben/raw/tip/notebooks/Wind_comparisons_jan2016.ipynb)  
    
    **HRDPS Evaluation January 2016**  
    This notebook compares the GEM 2.5 km HRDPS wind product to local windstation records for January 2016  

* ##[Wind_comparisons_mar2016.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-ben/raw/tip/notebooks/Wind_comparisons_mar2016.ipynb)  
    
    **HRDPS Evaluation March 2016**  
    This notebook compares the GEM 2.5 km HRDPS wind product to local windstation records for March 2016  

* ##[bathymetry_map.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-ben/raw/tip/notebooks/bathymetry_map.ipynb)  
    
    **Model Domain and Bathymetry**  
    This notebook plots the model domain and bathymetry over a basemap projection of the larger region.  

* ##[visualization_workflows_xarray.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-ben/raw/tip/notebooks/visualization_workflows_xarray.ipynb)  
    
    **Visualisation of NEMO/GEM/Observations using XArray**  
    This notebook demonstrates the use of several tools for easy loading and visualization of model results and drifter observations. Most of these tools require `xarray`, and rather than make them flexible to other packages, I thought I would just demonstrate their use with `xarray` here.  
      
    First we'll import the necessary libraries and set our preferred notebook formatting.  

* ##[HRDPS_correction.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-ben/raw/tip/notebooks/HRDPS_correction.ipynb)  
    
    **HRDPS Correction Check**  
    This notebook checks the HRDPS correction obtained from Luc Fillion's group  

* ##[Sechelt_current.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-ben/raw/tip/notebooks/Sechelt_current.ipynb)  
    
    **Sechelt Current Analysis**  
    This notebook estimates fluxes along the Sunshine Coast.  
      
    We can observe a northward current along the sunshine coast that changes in strength at subtidal frequencies. Let's analyze the flux through a cross-strait transect.  

* ##[Stakeholder_plots.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-ben/raw/tip/notebooks/Stakeholder_plots.ipynb)  
    
    **Stakeholder Plots**  
    Wind-driven currents plots for the Stakeholders 2016 meeting poster and brochure
